# Epic 5: User Feedback Collection

**Goal:** Users can easily share feedback; admins can review and manage submissions

## Story 5.1: Feedback Database Schema

As a **developer implementing feedback collection**,
I want **a database schema for storing feedback**,
So that **user feedback is persisted and queryable**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the database schema
**When** I review the feedback table definition
**Then** table exists in the project schema (e.g., `vt_saas.feedback`)
**And** table has id (uuid, primary key)
**And** table has message (text, required)
**And** table has type (enum: bug, feature, praise)
**And** table has user_id (uuid, nullable - for anonymous)
**And** table has user_email (text, nullable - for anonymous)
**And** table has status (enum: pending, reviewed, archived)
**And** table has created_at (timestamp)
**And** table has reviewed_at (timestamp, nullable)

**Given** the Drizzle schema
**When** I review `src/models/Schema.ts`
**Then** feedback table is defined with proper types
**And** enums are defined for type and status
**And** relations to users table (optional) are defined

**Given** the migration
**When** I run `npm run db:generate`
**Then** migration is created for feedback table
**And** migration applies successfully
**And** table is created in database

**Given** the feedback schema
**When** I query the table
**Then** indexes exist on user_id, status, created_at
**And** queries are performant

## Story 5.2: Feedback Widget Component

As a **user who wants to share feedback**,
I want **an easily accessible feedback widget**,
So that **I can quickly share my thoughts from any page**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** any page in the application
**When** I look for feedback option
**Then** I see a floating feedback button (bottom-right corner)
**And** button has a recognizable icon (speech bubble or similar)
**And** button doesn't obstruct important content

**Given** I click the feedback button
**When** the modal opens
**Then** I see a feedback form
**And** form has a message textarea
**And** form has type selection (Bug, Feature Request, Praise)
**And** form has a submit button
**And** modal can be closed with X or clicking outside

**Given** I am logged in
**When** I open the feedback form
**Then** my email is pre-filled (or associated automatically)
**And** I don't need to enter contact info

**Given** I am not logged in
**When** I open the feedback form
**Then** I see an optional email field
**And** I can submit anonymously or with email

**Given** the feedback form
**When** I select a feedback type
**Then** each type has a clear label and optional description
**And** selection is visually indicated
**And** default type is "Feature Request" or none

**Given** the feedback widget on mobile
**When** I view it on small screens
**Then** button is still visible but appropriately sized
**And** modal is full-screen or properly sized for mobile
**And** form is usable with touch keyboard

## Story 5.3: Feedback Submission API

As a **user submitting feedback**,
I want **my feedback saved reliably**,
So that **the team receives my input**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a valid feedback submission
**When** I submit the form
**Then** POST request is sent to `/api/feedback`
**And** feedback is saved to database
**And** I see a success message "Thanks for your feedback!"
**And** modal closes automatically

**Given** the feedback API endpoint
**When** I review the implementation
**Then** endpoint validates message (required, max length)
**And** endpoint validates type (must be valid enum)
**And** endpoint accepts optional user_id or email
**And** endpoint returns 201 on success

**Given** an authenticated user submits feedback
**When** the request is processed
**Then** user_id is automatically attached
**And** feedback is linked to their account

**Given** an anonymous user submits feedback
**When** they provide an email
**Then** email is stored with the feedback
**And** email is validated for format

**Given** validation errors
**When** submission is invalid
**Then** 400 response with field-level errors
**And** errors follow standard API error format
**And** user sees helpful error messages

**Given** the feedback submission
**When** I submit the form
**Then** I see loading state on submit button
**And** double-submission is prevented
**And** form resets after successful submission
